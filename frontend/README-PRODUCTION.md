# From the VivaranAI directory
cd frontend

# Start the production server
python serve-production.py

# Or specify a custom port
python serve-production.py 8080

# Auto-open in browser
python serve-production.py --open
```

### 2. Access the Dashboard

Open your browser to: `http://localhost:3000`

### 3. Test the System

1. **Check System Status**: The dashboard automatically checks API health on load
2. **Run Quick Tests**: Click any of the quick test buttons to verify functionality
3. **Upload a Document**: Use the file upload section to analyze a real medical bill
4. **Monitor Performance**: View real-time metrics and agent status

## Production URLs

- **Railway Backend**: `https://endearing-prosperity-production.up.railway.app`
- **API Health**: `https://endearing-prosperity-production.up.railway.app/health`
- **API Docs**: `https://endearing-prosperity-production.up.railway.app/docs`

## Testing Guide

### Basic Health Check
```bash
# The dashboard will automatically test:
curl https://endearing-prosperity-production.up.railway.app/health
```

### Quick Analysis Test
The dashboard includes a built-in quick test that:
1. Creates a sample medical bill
2. Encodes it to base64
3. Sends it to the `/analyze` endpoint
4. Displays the complete response

### File Upload Testing
1. Use the sample bills in `frontend/sample_bills/`
2. Upload through the dashboard
3. Monitor the analysis process
4. View detailed results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"API Offline" Status**
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify Railway deployment is running
   - Try switching to Development mode for local testing

2. **File Upload Fails**
   - Ensure file is under 15MB
   - Check file format (PDF, JPEG, PNG only)
   - Verify base64 encoding is working

3. **Analysis Takes Too Long**
   - Railway cold starts can take 30-60 seconds
   - Check system metrics for performance issues
   - Try the quick test first

### Debug Mode

Enable browser developer tools to see:
- Network requests and responses
- Console logs for debugging
- Performance metrics

## Development

### Local Development
```bash
# Start local backend first
python agents/server.py

# Then start frontend in development mode
cd frontend
python serve-production.py
# Switch to Development mode in the UI
```

### Customization

The dashboard is built with:
- **Alpine.js**: For reactive components
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling
- **Font Awesome**: For icons
- **Modern JavaScript**: ES6+ features

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the Railway logs: `railway logs`
2. Test individual endpoints manually
3. Verify the backend is running
4. Check network connectivity
