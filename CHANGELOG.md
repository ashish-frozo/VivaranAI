## Migration Guides

### Upgrading to v1.0.0

#### AI Web Scraping Integration

The major feature in v1.0.0 is the AI Web Scraping system. To leverage this:

1. **Update API calls** to use new endpoints:
   ```python
   # Old static approach
   result = await agent.analyze_with_static_data(bill_content)
   
   # New AI web scraping approach
   result = await smart_agent.fetch_relevant_data(
       document_text=extracted_text,
       document_type="medical_bill",
       state_code="DL"
   )
   ```

2. **Configure new environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export ENABLE_WEB_SCRAPING=true
   export CACHE_TTL=21600  # 6 hours
   export MAX_SCRAPING_SOURCES=10
   ```

3. **Update dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install beautifulsoup4 playwright lxml
   ```

#### Multi-Agent Architecture

The new multi-agent system provides specialized analysis:

```python
# Enhanced document processing
from agents.tools.enhanced_router_agent import EnhancedRouterAgent

router = EnhancedRouterAgent()
result = await router.process_document(file_content, doc_id)
```

#### Breaking Changes

- **API Response Format**: Enhanced response structure with additional metadata
- **Configuration**: New environment variables required for AI features
- **Dependencies**: Additional packages required for web scraping

#### Deprecated Features

- Static JSON-only rate validation (still supported but not recommended)
- Simple OCR without AI enhancement (replaced by multi-provider OCR)
